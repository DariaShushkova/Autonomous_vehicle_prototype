# Autonomous Vehicle Prototype

## Overview

This part of the project implements an Arduino-based autonomous vehicle prototype. The vehicle uses line detection and obstacle avoidance, including color-based object handling, to navigate predefined tracks. Supports routing variations like ovals, figure-eights, and parking maneuvers.

## Features

- Line tracking
- Obstacle detection and avoidance
- Color-based decision logic
- Speed optimization
- Supports various driving patterns (oval, figure-eight, parking)

## Simulation

The project is modeled and tested using Tinkercad.
